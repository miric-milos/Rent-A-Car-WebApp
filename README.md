# PHP Rent-a-car

Rent-a-car web app, developed using vanilla PHP, JQuery, HTML, CSS (Bootstrap).
App includes authentication.
Import the database file in your MySql DB manager software and rename the connection string in 'Baza.php' to make it work.

The app was created as a school project, I was working on this with my colleague whose GitHub link will be added soon.
